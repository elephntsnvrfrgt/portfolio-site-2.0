								p.fadeInMove Aflac came to Publicis Sapient for a homepage refresh.  We found that many folks knew Aflac for “the duck” but didn’t actually know who or what they did. Their existing homepage was on the extreme, utilitarian end of the spectrum and didn’t give any context. We aimed to evolve it into something that was fun, reassuring, and eductational while still providing the utility.
